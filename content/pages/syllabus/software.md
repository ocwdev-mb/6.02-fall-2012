You will need to download and install the software we'll be using. Stand-alone installers exist for almost any modern computing environment. For package-based systems, there are packages you can install to supply the needed software. Here are the versions we've tried:

Windows
-------

[Python (2.7.x)](http://python.org/download/)

[wxPython (2.8 Unicode for Python 2.7)](http://www.wxpython.org/download.php)

[numpy (1.5.1 for Python 2.7)](http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/1.5.1/)

[matplotlib (1.0.1 for Python 2.7)](http://sourceforge.net/projects/matplotlib/files/)

If you're working at home, use "idle -n" to edit and run your code; an integrated development environment makes the work go more swiftly.

Mac OS X 10.6
-------------

Here are the current packages for the latest Mac OS X releases (you'll want to go with the 32-bit versions as some of the math libraries we use aren't yet available as 64-bit versions):

[Python (2.7.1 for Mac OS X 10.3â€“10.6) (DMG)](http://python.org/ftp/python/2.7.1/python-2.7.1-macosx10.3.dmg)

[wxPython (2.8 Unicode for Python 2.7) (DMG)](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/wxpython/wxPython2.8-osx-unicode-2.8.11.0-universal-py2.7.dmg)

[numpy (1.5.1 for Python 2.7) (DMG)](http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/1.5.1/numpy-1.5.1-py2.7-python.org-macosx10.5.dmg/download)

[matplotlib (1.0.1 for Python 2.7) (DMG)](http://sourceforge.net/projects/matplotlib/files/matplotlib/matplotlib-1.0.1/matplotlib-1.0.1-python.org-32bit-py2.7-macosx10.3.dmg/download)

64-bit Windows
--------------

A large collection of 64-bit Windows packages is available at [Python Extension Packages for Windows](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/). It contains numpy, as well as most everything else you need for Python.
